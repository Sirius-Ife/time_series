# Time Series Forecasting with Pallet Pricing Data

## Overview

This project focuses on time series forecasting techniques applied to pallet pricing data. The goal is to develop models that accurately predict future pallet prices based on historical data. The project includes exploratory data analysis, autocorrelation analysis, and modeling using various time series forecasting methods.

## Data

The dataset used in this project consists of historical pallet pricing data. It includes the following columns:

- Date: The date of the pricing data.
- Price: The price of pallets on the given date.

The data was collected over a specific time period and includes both seasonal and non-seasonal variations in pallet prices.

## Methodology

The project follows these main steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The data is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and any other anomalies.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Exploratory analysis is conducted to understand the distribution of pallet prices over time, identify trends, seasonality, and any other patterns.

3. **Autocorrelation Analysis:** Autocorrelation analysis is performed to examine the correlation between a time series and its lagged values. This helps identify the presence of autocorrelation and determine the appropriate lag for forecasting models.

4. **Modeling:** Various time series forecasting models are implemented and evaluated, including but not limited to:
   - Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
   - Exponential Smoothing Methods (e.g., Holt-Winters)

5. **Model Evaluation:** The performance of each model is assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Results

The results of the time series forecasting models are presented, including insights gained from the analysis and implications for pallet pricing prediction.

## Dependencies

- R: The project is implemented using the R programming language.
- Libraries: The following R libraries are used for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling:
  - dplyr
  - ggplot2
  - forecast
  - tidyverse
